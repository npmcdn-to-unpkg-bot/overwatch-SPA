Covering the requirements:

API Fetch: This will use the overwatch API to gather player data. Users can hover over a post to see that persons latest stats and info (kd ratio, icon, level etc)
C.R.U.D: The user will fill out some fields user name (for api grab), if they're LFG or LFM (looking for members) and their prefered role they'd like to play as (out of Attack, Defense, Tank, Support).

At the moment it will be universally deletable but hopefully I can add OAuth so only content made by them can be deleted? hopefully?
